# Exercise-Tracker
This project is a web application designed to track exercises and workouts using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. It allows users to manage their exercise routines, including adding new exercises, viewing their exercise history, updating existing entries, and deleting exercises.

## Technologies Used
1. MongoDB
2. Express.js
3. React
4. Node.js

## Features
1. User Account Creation:
  Users must create an account by providing basic information, such as a username. Account creation is mandatory to access the tracker. The user information is securely stored in the database for future use.

2. Adding Exercise Entries:
  Registered users can log new exercise entries, detailing the exercise name, duration, intensity, and other relevant information. This allows users to track their workouts effectively.

3. Viewing Exercise History:
  Users can view a list of their past exercise entries. The list can be sorted by date, exercise type, or other criteria to help users easily find and review their workout history.

4. Updating Exercise Entries:
  Users can update existing exercise entries to correct information or reflect changes in their workout routines. This ensures that the exercise data remains accurate and up-to-date.

5. Removing Exercise Entries:
  Users have the option to delete exercise entries that are no longer needed. This helps in maintaining a clean and relevant exercise history.

6. Data Management with MongoDB:
  MongoDB is used to store user profiles and exercise data. It supports efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing for smooth management of user and exercise information.
